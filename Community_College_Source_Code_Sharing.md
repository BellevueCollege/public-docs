# Community College Source Code Sharing

## Licencing

There is no software licence agreement currently in effect for the software products Bellevue College produces. Previously, applications that were developed in conjunction with other colleges (specifically, the HSC/IMS Interchange projects) were released under the Common Public License (CPL). It would be advantageous for us to adopt a standard open source license for use with the software that we create. This would not only provide some legal protection but also set clear expectations of the how our software should be used, modified, and supported.

Some feel that one of the GPL licences (GPLv2 or GPLv3) seems to most closely match the college's goal in sharing code with other colleges while making sure their changes or contributions are made available to others. The CPL was chosen previously, in part, because it encourages but does not require derivative work be shared back to the original project. At the time, there was concern that establishing such an obligation could become a barrier to wider adoption. More discussion is needed on this topic.

## Source Code Management Model

All software projects will have a management team of one to four people. The management team will handle all source code merges to the stable branch of the project code. The management team should be deeply familiar with the software source code if not the original developer who wrote the initial code for the project.


If an developer outside of the management team has made changes to a project that they want merged into the stable branch, that developer should submit their changes to the management team so that the changes can be reviewed and merged where appropriate.
