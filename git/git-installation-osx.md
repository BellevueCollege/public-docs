#Git Installation on OSX / MacOS
MacOS comes with Git as part of Xcode.

## Install Xcode command line tools
```
xcode-select --install
```

The first time you use Git it may ask you to run the command as `sudo`
and sign a licence agreement before you are allowed to proceed.

## Newer Git Options
The version of Git bundled with MacOS is often not the most recent.
If you would like a more up-to-date version installed, check out
